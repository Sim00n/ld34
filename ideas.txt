= ================================================== =

Theme interpretation:
- growing = expanding
- growing = development
- growing = spreading (kinda like a bacteria - think the game "Plague Inc." on iOS)
- growing cities?
- growing communities? maps? enemies? waves of enemies?
-

Final idea? maybe?
- "Democracy 3" kind of controls
- Each "tile" has 1 state = on/off (one button)
- End goal: growing whatever you started with
= World
 - 


Ideas:
- 2D
- Once screen, side scroll mechanics - kinds like space invaders?
- some kind of clicker with a cool graphics theme?
- some kind of building game as in growing a settlement or a city
- two button control being yes/no as answers to questions? (text based game?)
- tower defence (enemies growing in numbers/strength/speed/agility?)
- so you want to be a millionaire? (two choices only)
- two buttons to rewind time?
- simple skill based game where you have to select a button in certain amount if time?

Two button control:
- two button: either keyboard, both mouse buttons or one of each
- moving left and right to collect shit
- there are always two buttons to use? choose from? find?

Growing:
- farming?
- character growth
- growing by collecting stuff?
- taking care of a (marijuana) plant, giving it light, water, nutrients, etc.
